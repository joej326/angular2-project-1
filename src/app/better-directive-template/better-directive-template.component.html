<!-- the property-bound 'hoveredBackground' is in the directive and we can change it to whatever we please.

we can take out the property-binding here and it will still run because the hoveredBackground is already
defined inside the directive.
Basically, this enables someone to easily change the functionality of the app easily -->
<h1 appBetterDirective [hoveredBackground]="'yellow'">hello</h1>
